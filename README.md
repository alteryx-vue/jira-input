> An Alteryx Connector built with Vue.js and Vuetify

#### (PRE-RELEASE, UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

The Jira Input connector for Alteryx downloads project issues from your Jira instance REST API.  This is an updated version of the [original Alteryx macro](https://gallery.alteryx.com/#!app/JIRA-Connector/58d87c2feffc2a0dd0b5ed8f) in the public [Alteryx Gallery](https://gallery.alteryx.com).

# New Features
- Pull issues from multiple projects
- Pull all available issues with single tool instance (recursive pagination)
- Enhanced field selection
- Enhanced filtering with JQL support

### Requirements
- [NodeJS/npm](https://nodejs.org)


## Install/Download

A compiled build can be installed with the [.YXI installer here]() or by downloading from the [Alteryx Gallery]().  Use the instructions below for installing from source.

### Clone to one of the Alteryx tool directories

Alteryx will typically install tools in one of the following locations:
``` bash
C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Alteryx\Tools
C:\Program Files\Alteryx\bin\HtmlPlugins
C:\ProgramData\Alteryx\Tools
```

#### Choose a location, clone and cd to project
``` bash
# as of Designer 2018.1 this is the preferred global directory
cd C:\ProgramData\Alteryx\Tools

# clone 
git clone https://github.com/alteryx-vue/jira-input

# cd to project
cd jira-input
```

## Build Setup & Testing

### Dev Environment Testing

You can use `npm run dev` to serve the project with hot reload for testing in a browser.  
>limited functionality in browser - use for Vue component and/or state management debugging, etc.

__Note__: When using Chrome, be sure to make use of the [Vue.js Devtools Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)
